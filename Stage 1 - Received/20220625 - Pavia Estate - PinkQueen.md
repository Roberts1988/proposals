** Proposal Summary **

In order to position ourselves in Metaverse as DAO, we need to acquire land to later build buildings for exposure and contact with our holders and new investors. Today we only have land on BossPlanet and in order for us to reach out to other groups and diversify towards BCRC, we also need to be available on PAVIA.

** Background **
In order for Boss DAO to succeed in establishing itself as the best investment DAO on Cardano, we need to constantly stay relevant and be available in the places where our holders and potential new investors gather. It is therefore important that BossDAO has offices in more Metaverse than just BossPlanet. Since our aim is also to diversify ourselves from being overexposed to the BCRC, this is also an important step to take. Boss DAO need to gain ground by proving itself available in Metaverse, it can be one of the most important channels to meet and find new investors.

** About Pavia **
Pavia is the first OG project on Cardano to start building on a Metaverse, the name is from the Italian city of Pavia, which was home to Gerolamo Cardano in the 1500s. The platform comprises several thousand land parcels held by a community of 21500 holders. Although the pace of development is difficult to assess, they have enough traction to be able to establish themselves as a top tier Metaverse on Cardano, some like to compare them with Decentraland. 
Pavia is still in its infancy and the exact layout of Pavia is yet to be generally available (apart from a basic map), it will have six distinct areas â€” land, sand, sea, deep sea, mountain, and forest scenes. Pavia will also have ready-to-use builders, marketplaces, scenes, and deployment tools that anyone can use, without special technical expertise. The team consists of 18 people with different backgrounds, most recently the recruitment was COO Paul who has worked with game launches such as Apex Legends.

Proposal Details

* Investment in PAVIA estate

Boss DAO will utilize 100 ADA per week for small community games like smash karts, rumble royale or any other community events. The left over ada will not be transfered
to next week, e.g. if we use 70 ada this week then we would need to add only 70 ada from the Royalty wallet.




* Special Events

Boss DAO will utilize up to 200 ada from the Royalty wallet, the ada will be spent on some smaller nfts and new projects that have minted recently
up to a sum of 200 ada. These NFT will be given away to winners of the special events.

* Sweep Contests

We will use 100 - 200 ADA for the rewards of the sweeping contest. 

* Collaborations

In case of Collaboration event with other NFT project we would want to promote Boss DAO in the best way possible, the ada from the treasury wallet will be used
to purchase 1 Boss DAO governance token which is going to be used in that particular promotion. The token will be purchased from the floor which will increase floor value
of our Boss DAO governance tokens and promote our project to other communities. Price  of the Boss DAO GT varies, current floor price is 105 ADA. Doing this hopefully attract new holders for the project. 

* Seasonal giveways

We want to be on par with other NFT projects when it comes to giveways during the high season like Christmas. Our royalty wallet will buy one of the bigger project NFT's 
and will give it away during those periods. The sum may warry between 500 - 1500 ADA. This is done to promote our brand during holiday seasons.

* Twitter giveaways

During our mint periods we had ongoing giveaways from Boss DAO twitter account to promote our minting. I propose that we use a portion of ADA during those times  as it will 
raise the awarness and promote Boss DAO.

* Marketing & Branding

Boss DAO will utilize royalty wallet to pay for following services as needed. Services could include artists, payed promotion or any other creative piece that DAO may need in the future. This could be a one time cost of 500 - 2000 ADA.
